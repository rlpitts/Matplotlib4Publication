## Matplotlib for Publication
Notebooks and training exercises for the "Matplotlib for Publication" tutorial workshop, hosted at Lund University for students, faculty, and staff affiliated with NAISS. The demo plotting code used during code-along breaks in the lectures is one that students are expected to write up themselves. The instructor copy will not be shared.

The lecture materials will be available in `Matplotlib4Pub-slides.pdf`, but it is recommended that students not refer to them until after the presentations unless they are stuck, since the code for slides titled "Now you try!" is not hidden. You learn and retain more by trying for yourself first!

The 4 `.ipynb` files are the exercises and solutions, which depend on data from the `exoplanets_5245_EarthUnits.csv` file. The exoplanet CSV files are convenient public training data sets from Kaggle (the one for the exercises was adapted from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityamishraml/nasaexoplanets and cleaned up).

##### STUDENTS & TUTORS:
- Download `'exoplanets_5245_EarthUnits.csv'` to use as the data file for the first set of exercises.
- Download `imshow_heatmap.py` to use for the last exercise of day 2.
- Optionally, also download mpl4publication.mplstyle for viewing/use.
