## Matplotlib for Publication
Notebooks and training exercises for the "Matplotlib for Publication" tutorial workshop, hosted at Lund University for students, faculty, and staff affiliated with NAISS. I have covered as much material as I felt I could cram into two 1-hour lectures and a 2-hour assignment.

`MatplotlibTraining.ipynb` contains the lecture materials (slides are available in the .pdf file of the same name), and the other 2 .ipynb files are the exercises and solutions. Some code blocks and demo images in MatplotlibTraining.ipynb rely on downloaded or hyperlinked data. In the case of the `titanic_train.csv`, loading the file from URL requires an account login even though the data are public, and the `'mpl4publication.mplstyle` file must be in your CWD to run the last block of code in the notebook as-is. If you wish to run all cells, download all non-ipynb files to be safe.

The exoplanet CSV files are convenient public training data sets from Kaggle (the one for the exercises was adapted from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityamishraml/nasaexoplanets), to be used in a demo and the exercises.

##### STUDENTS & TUTORS:
- Download 'exoplanets_5250_EarthUnits.csv' to use as the data file for the first set of exercises.
- Download imshow_heatmap.py to use for exercise set 3.
- Optionally, also download mpl4publication.mplstyle for viewing/use, and Earth.png for the bonus challenge prompt at the end of exercise 1-3.
