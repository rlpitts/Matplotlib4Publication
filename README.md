# LUNARC_training
notebooks and training exercises for LU students

MatplotlibTraining.ipynb file is the main lecture. Other ipynb file(s) are the assignments.
The EU exoplanet CSV files are convenient public training data sets from Kaggle, to be used in one of the assignments.

STUDENTS & TUTORS: Use 'exoplanets_5250_EarthUnits.csv' as the data file for the first set of exercises. The others have lots of extra variables that we won't work with.

Still a WIP. Hopefully ready to go public in early November.
