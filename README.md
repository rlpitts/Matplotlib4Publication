# LUNARC_training
notebooks and training exercises for LU students

MatplotlibTraining.ipynb file is the main lecture. Other ipynb files (to come) are the assignments.
The EU exoplanet CSV file is a convenient public training data set from Kaggle, to be used in one of the assignments.

Very early WIP. Hopefully ready to go public in early November.
